For this we would need 2 separate databases off the bat.

One(SQL) would be for transactions/payment.

The other(TBD) would be for each order made, containing the items ordered, what type of order(dine-in, delivery, pickup).

Feel free to let me know if there are others needed for this, if there should be changes in how they should
be set up, or anything else.
