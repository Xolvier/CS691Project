I wondered how mySQL or any SQL database could hold a list of all the items that were purchased and how many for each and every 
distinct order.

For every order, the size of that list/array is variable. The quantity of each item in that list would also be variable.
So we need something very flexible. 

I'm thinking storing this data in JSON format would be the way to go(MongoDB/NoSQL), because parameters for JSON is not strict, it can be 
whatever size. All I remember from SQL is that fields/attributes do not hold arrays of variable size.

Am I looking at this the wrong way? Or is there a better way to do this?
I would like to know some thoughts you guys may have regarding this.
