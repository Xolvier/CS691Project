I was thinking for orders(which will be the unique primary key for all/most applications) should be safely written if it took 
this format:

OrderID
1909250000

First two digits(19 above) - 19 would signify 2019, only takes 2 digits, allowing for format use until 2099 seems safe to me.
Second two digits(09 above) - 09 would signify September, so this will range from 01 and 12 at any given number.
Third two digits(25 above) - 25 would mean 25th day.
Last four digits(0000 above) - means which order on that date essentially.

First order on any day is always 0000 for last four digits.
Last possible order on any day is 9999.

This format is safe because I do not know of any single restaurant location that serves over 10000 orders on any given day.

On top of being safe, it's also meaningful, and may be useful for searches or sorts when boiling all orders down to year, month, date.

I imagine if there was ever an issue with a customer, theyre ticket would read a ticket number anywhere from 0000 to 9999, 
it would also show the date for when they arrived for food. If they aren't sure about what ticket number and do not have the ticket 
or receipt, they can at least recall the day they arrived(search would be something along the lines of "20190926$$$$")
